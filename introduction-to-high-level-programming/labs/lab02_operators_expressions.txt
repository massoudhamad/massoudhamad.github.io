         INTRODUCTION TO HIGH-LEVEL PROGRAMMING (C++)
         PRACTICAL LAB SESSION 2: Operators & Expressions
         State University of Zanzibar (SUZA)
================================================================================

OBJECTIVES:
- Master arithmetic, relational, and logical operators
- Understand operator precedence and associativity
- Work with type casting and mixed expressions
- Solve real-world calculation problems

================================================================================
PART A: OPERATOR PRECEDENCE (From Course Materials)
================================================================================

1. State the order of evaluation of the operators in each statement and show
   the value of x after each is performed:
   a) x = 7 + 3 * 6 / 2 - 1
   b) x = 2 % 2 + 2 * 2 - 2 / 2
   c) x = (3 * 9 * (3 + (9 * 3 / (3))))

   Write a C++ program to verify your answers.

2. Write a program to input two integers x and y. Calculate and display the
   quotient and remainder when x is divided by y.

3. Sales Tax: Ask the user for purchase amount. Calculate:
   - State sales tax (4%)
   - County sales tax (2%)
   - Total sales tax
   - Total sale amount
   Display all values.

4. Tip, Tax, and Total: Ask for food charge. Calculate and display:
   - 15% tip amount
   - 7% sales tax amount
   - Total bill

5. Stock Transaction Program:
   Joe bought 1,000 shares at $32.87/share (2% broker commission).
   Joe sold 1,000 shares at $33.92/share (2% broker commission).
   Calculate and display:
   - Amount paid for stock
   - Commission on purchase
   - Amount received from sale
   - Commission on sale
   - Net profit or loss


================================================================================
PART B: TYPE CASTING & MIXED EXPRESSIONS
================================================================================

6. Integer Division vs Float Division
   Write a program that demonstrates the difference between:
   - 7 / 2 (integer division)
   - 7.0 / 2 (float division)
   - (float)7 / 2 (type casting)
   - static_cast<float>(7) / 2 (C++ style cast)

7. Temperature Table
   Print a conversion table from Celsius to Fahrenheit for temperatures
   0, 10, 20, 30, ..., 100 degrees Celsius.
   Formula: F = (9.0/5.0) * C + 32
   Output format:
       Celsius    Fahrenheit
       0          32.0
       10         50.0
       ...

8. Compound Interest
   A = P * (1 + r/n)^(nt)
   Where: P=principal, r=annual rate, n=times compounded/year, t=years
   Ask user for P, r, n, t and calculate final amount A.
   Use pow() from <cmath>.

PART C: EXTRA PRACTICE (LeetCode / HackerRank Style)
================================================================================

9. [Easy] Even or Odd Check
   Read an integer and print whether it is even or odd using the % operator.
   Do NOT use if-else — use the ternary operator: (n%2==0) ? "Even" : "Odd"
   Test: 7 -> Odd, 12 -> Even

10. [Easy] Absolute Value
    Read a number and print its absolute value WITHOUT using abs().
    Hint: if negative, multiply by -1.
    Test: -5 -> 5, 3 -> 3, 0 -> 0

11. [Easy] Check Divisibility
    Read two numbers a and b. Check if a is divisible by b.
    Print "Divisible" or "Not divisible".
    Test: 15, 5 -> Divisible | 14, 3 -> Not divisible

12. [Medium] Count Digits
    Read a positive integer and count how many digits it has using only
    arithmetic (divide by 10 repeatedly).
    Test: 12345 -> 5 digits | 100 -> 3 digits | 7 -> 1 digit

13. [Medium] Power Without pow()
    Calculate x^n (x raised to power n) using only multiplication.
    Read x and n (positive integer). Use a loop.
    Test: 2^10 = 1024 | 3^5 = 243

14. [HackerRank] Solve Me First
    Read two integers. Print their sum. (Warm-up problem)

15. [LeetCode 7 - Simplified] Reverse Integer
    Read an integer and print it reversed.
    Test: 123 -> 321 | -456 -> -654 | 1200 -> 21
    Hint: Use % 10 to get last digit, / 10 to remove it.

16. [LeetCode 9 - Simplified] Palindrome Number
    Read an integer. Check if it reads the same forwards and backwards.
    Test: 121 -> Palindrome | 123 -> Not palindrome | -121 -> Not palindrome
    Hint: Reverse the number and compare.
