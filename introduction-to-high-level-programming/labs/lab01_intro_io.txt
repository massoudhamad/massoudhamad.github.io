         PRACTICAL LAB SESSION 1: Introduction, Output & Variables
         State University of Zanzibar (SUZA)
================================================================================

OBJECTIVES:
- Set up development environment and compile first C++ program
- Understand cout, endl, escape sequences
- Declare variables of different types
- Basic input/output with cin and cout

================================================================================
PART A: GETTING STARTED (From Course Materials)
================================================================================

1. Write a C++ program to print 'Hello' on screen and then print your name
   on a separate line.
   Expected Output:
       Hello
       Alexandra Abramov

2. Write a C++ program to print the following strings:
   Expected Output:
       Tomorrow I'll learn C++ Data types.
       This is a bad command: del c:\*.*

3. Write a C++ program to declare one integer variable, one float variable,
   and one string variable and assign 10, 12.5, and "C++ programming" to
   them respectively. Then display their values on the screen.

4. Write a program that will print your initials to standard output in letters
   that are nine lines tall. Each big letter should be made up of *'s.
   Example for "DJE":
       ******        ************     *********
       **    **            **         **
       **     **           **         **
       **      **          **         **
       **      **          **         *********
       **      **    **    **         **
       **     **     **    **         **
       **    **      **   **          **
       ******         ****            *********

5. Write programs to print EACH of the following star patterns:
   Pattern A: 5x5 solid square of stars
   Pattern B: 5x5 hollow square of stars
   Pattern C: Inverted triangle of stars
   Pattern D: Diamond of stars


================================================================================
PART B: INPUT, VARIABLES & ARITHMETIC (From Course Materials)
================================================================================

6. Write a program that displays:
   - Your name
   - Your address, with city, state, and ZIP
   - Your telephone number
   - Your college major

7. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and age. Display:
   "Welcome [name] you are [age] years old"

8. Write a program that asks for two float values and adds them together.
   The result should be assigned to the first variable.
   Example:
       Enter value a: 12.5
       The value of a before adding is 12.5.
       Enter value b: 34.9
       The value of a after adding is 47.4.

9. Write a program that reads two integers and prints the results of adding,
   subtracting, multiplying, and dividing them.

10. Write a program that requests two numbers and prints the sum, product,
    difference and quotient of the two numbers.


================================================================================
PART C: FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS (From Course Materials)
================================================================================

11. Sales Prediction: A company's annual profit is 23% of total sales. Ask
    the user for projected total sales and display the profit.

12. Land Calculation: One acre = 43,560 square feet. Ask user for total
    square feet and calculate the number of acres.

13. Total Purchase: A customer buys 5 items. Ask for each price, then display
    subtotal, 6% sales tax, and total.

14. Distance Traveled: Distance = Speed * Time. A car travels at 60 mph.
    Display distance for 5, 8, and 12 hours.

15. Miles-per-Gallon: MPG = Miles / Gallons. Ask user for miles driven and
    gallons used, calculate and display MPG.

16. Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (9/5)*C + 32. Ask user for Celsius
    temperature and display the Fahrenheit equivalent.

17. Circle calculations: Read radius, print diameter, circumference, and area.
    Use pi = 3.14159.

18. Age in seconds: Ask for first name, last name, and age in years. Display:
    "Welcome [first] [last]! You are ______ seconds old!"


================================================================================
PART D: EXTRA PRACTICE (LeetCode / HackerRank Style)
================================================================================

19. [Easy] Swap Two Variables
    Read two integers and swap their values WITHOUT using a third variable.
    Hint: Use arithmetic operations (a = a + b, b = a - b, a = a - b).
    Test: a=5, b=10 -> After swap: a=10, b=5

20. [Easy] Last Digit
    Read an integer and print its last digit.
    Test: Input: 1234 -> Output: 4
    Test: Input: 99   -> Output: 9

21. [Easy] Digit Sum (2-digit number)
    Read a 2-digit number and print the sum of its digits.
    Test: Input: 47 -> Output: 11 (4+7)
    Test: Input: 83 -> Output: 11 (8+3)

22. [Easy] Reverse a 3-digit Number
    Read a 3-digit number and print it reversed.
    Test: Input: 123 -> Output: 321
    Test: Input: 905 -> Output: 509

23. [Medium] Time Conversion
    Read a number of seconds and convert it to hours, minutes, and seconds.
    Test: Input: 3661 -> Output: 1 hour, 1 minute, 1 second
    Test: Input: 7384 -> Output: 2 hours, 3 minutes, 4 seconds

24. [HackerRank] Simple Array Sum
    Read N numbers and print their sum.
    Input: 6 numbers: 1 2 3 4 10 11
    Output: 31
